# 487 DBImplementation - Wisconsin Benchmark \
###Introduction

The main purpose of the project is to evaluate a single ‘relational’ system by changing parameters and varying relation sizes. In this project, Wisconsin benchmark data was generated and loaded into a database system. As a result, we generated three tables; one with 1000 tuples (called Onektup) and the other two contained 10000 tuples each (called Tenktup1 and Tenktup2). \
