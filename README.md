### Introduction
    
    The main purpose of the project is to evaluate a single ‘relational’ system by changing parameters and varying relation sizes. In this project, Wisconsin benchmark data was generated and loaded into a database system. As a result, we generated three tables; one with 1000 tuples (called Onektup) and the other two contained 10000 tuples each (called Tenktup1 and Tenktup2). 


The data was generated using Neha’s python scripted program for extracting scalable Wisconsin Benchmark data.  The program converted the three sets of data, the 1K and two 10K, into csv files. Furthermore, they were moved into the “script” folder under the PostgreSQL folder.
